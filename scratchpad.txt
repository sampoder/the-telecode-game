You'll connect through an SSH server.

You'll join a room (create one or enter a code). 

The room's creator can then "start" a game.

You write a prompt.

Someone writes some code for that prompt.

Someone else tries to create a prompt for that code.

And the cycle continues.

At the end of the cycle, the inital prompt and the final code is shown.
